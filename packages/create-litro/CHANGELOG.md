# create-litro

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 618a9b8: Rename all packages to `@beatzball` scope. The unscoped `litro` package was blocked by npm's name-similarity protection (too close to `lit`, `listr`, etc.). All three packages are now published under the `@beatzball` org scope:

  - `litro` → `@beatzball/litro`
  - `litro-router` → `@beatzball/litro-router`
  - `create-litro` → `@beatzball/create-litro`

  The previously published unscoped `litro-router@0.0.2` and `create-litro@0.0.2` are deprecated on npm with a redirect notice.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 4552934: Add `license`, `repository`, and `publishConfig` fields to all published packages; configure Changesets for automated version management, per-package changelogs, and npm publishing via GitHub Actions.
